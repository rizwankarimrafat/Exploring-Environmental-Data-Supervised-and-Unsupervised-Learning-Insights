# Exploring Environmental Data: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Insights

This project focuses on analyzing a large environmental dataset using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The primary goal is to uncover relationships between various environmental factors and to identify hidden patterns within the data. Through the application of multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and k-means clustering, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in deriving meaningful insights from complex environmental data.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **Multiple Linear Regression:** The project uses multiple linear regression to model the relationship between environmental factors and specific outcomes, such as the length of stay for patients. By analyzing variables like air quality parameters (CO, O3, NO2, SO2, PPM10), weather conditions (precipitation, humidity, windspeed), and their impact on patient stay duration, the study identifies the most influential factors and provides a predictive model.

2. **Multiple Logistic Regression:** The logistic regression analysis focuses on predicting binary outcomes, such as the likelihood of asthma attacks, based on environmental factors and patient characteristics. This approach helps in understanding the probabilistic relationships between the environment and health outcomes, offering valuable insights for early detection and response strategies.

3. **K-Means Clustering:** Unsupervised learning through k-means clustering is applied to discover natural groupings within the dataset. This technique reveals underlying patterns and categories that might not be apparent through traditional analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the environmental data.

## Conclusion
The project successfully applies a multidimensional approach to environmental data analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in extracting valuable insights. The combination of regression models and clustering algorithms provides a comprehensive understanding of how environmental factors interact and influence outcomes, contributing to more informed environmental management practices.
